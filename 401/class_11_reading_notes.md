## Questions

1. What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?

    Key Features:

    - Text, code Consoles, & Terminals
    - Common Formats: Jupyter Lab support a variety of file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc)
    - Jupyter Notebooks: a way to work with code seamlessly together

    JupyterLab is an open-source web-based interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. It is the next-generation user interface for Jupyter Notebooks and provides a more flexible and powerful environment for scientific computing.

    - Multi-document interface: JupyterLab allows you to work on multiple notebooks, scripts, and data files simultaneously in a single interface.
    - Customizable user interface: JupyterLab allows users to customize their interface by adding or removing panels, changing their position, and resizing them.
    - Built-in terminal: JupyterLab has a built-in terminal, which allows users to interact with the operating system and execute shell commands within the interface.
    - Modular architecture: JupyterLab is built on a modular architecture, which allows users to extend its functionality by developing their own extensions

    In terms of differences between JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab provides a more comprehensive and customizable interface than Jupyter Notebook. While Jupyter Notebook provides a single document interface, JupyterLab enables users to work on multiple documents and notebooks simultaneously.

    Shortcuts:

    - `-` & `=`: Zoom in/out
    - `[` & `]`: Rotate left/right
    - `0`: reset

    Jupyter Notebook Shortcuts:

    - `a`: add a cell above
    - `b`: add a cell below
    - `dd`: delete
    - `y`: code
    -`m`: markdown
    - `shift` + `ENTER`: to run a cell

2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

Numpy (Numeric Python) is a Python data analysis package

3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
