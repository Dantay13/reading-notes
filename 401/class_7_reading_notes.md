## Reading questions

1. Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

    Variable scope in Python refers to the region in which a variable is accessible. There are two types of variable scope in Python - local and global. Local scope refers to variables that are defined within a function and can only be accessed from within that function. Global scope refers to variables that are defined outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

2. How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?

    In Python, there are two keywords: global and nonlocal that are used to modify variables in different situations. The global keyword is used to modify variables that are available everywhere in the program, while the nonlocal keyword is used to modify variables in an outer function from inside a nested function. By using these keywords, you can change the values of variables depending on your specific needs.

3. In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.

4. Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.
