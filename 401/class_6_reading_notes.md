## Reading Questions

1. How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?

    The random module is used to generate random numbers and make selections from a list. To use the random module, you need to import it at the beginning of your Python file.

    - It generate a random whole number or fraction between 0 and 1
    - It select a random itm from a list

2. In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?

    In software development, risk analysis is the process of looking for things that could go wrong in a project, and figuring out how likely they are to happen and how much they could impact the project. This helps people plan ahead and prevent problems from happening.

    How to perform Risk Analysis?

    There are three steps:

    A. Searching the risk
    B. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
    C. Measures for the risk identified

3. What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?

    Test coverage is a measure used in software testing to find out how much of the source code has been tested. Test coverage can still miss important bugs. So, it is important to used along with other testing methods to ensure the software is reliable.

4. What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.
