## Reading Questions

1. In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?

    1. Arrow Functions: ES6 introduced arrow functions, providing a shorter syntax for creating function expressions.
    2. Template Literals: Template literals enable easier string interpolation and multi-line strings.
    3. Destructuring (Object Matching): Destructuring allows for extracting multiple properties from an object and assigning them to variables in a single line.

2. After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?

    Utility classes in Tailwind CSS, are small, reusable classes that contain one or two CSS properties. They enable developers to build custom designs without writing custom CSS, promoting faster development and better maintainability. For example, an `<h2>` element can be styled using utility classes like text-lg for large text, text-indigo-600 for color, border-b for a bottom border, and mb-3 for bottom margin, allowing for a flexible and efficient approach to styling without the need for custom CSS code.

3. Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.

    Next.js, offers significant advantages in web development, including a hybrid rendering approach that allows for client-side, server-side, or mixed rendering, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Compared to traditional client-side rendering, Next.js's server-side rendering offers more versatility, enabling developers to choose the rendering method that best suits each page or feature, resulting in a more efficient and tailored development experience.
