### Google and AI

I fully agree that Google, being a global company, shouldn't be involved in military deals or make tech for specific military groups. Google's strength is its worldwide presence and diverse team. So, it's concerning when they work on projects that might harm people from areas where they have employees. I support the Google workers who were upset about this. It's important to think about how such projects might affect their own team members from different parts of the world. Google should stay neutral and think about its employees and users worldwide.

### Cyber-Security of self driving cars

Navigating the ethical landscape of autonomous vehicles is challenging. At the heart of the matter is the difference between human empathy and the cold logic of technology. While humans possess the innate ability to empathize and consider, technology operates purely on logic and algorithms. However, the advancement of this technology is inevitable. In light of this, the best approach would be to program the vehicle to prioritize the safety of its passengers in any no-win scenario. If another vehicle, equipped with similar technology is also involved, it would ideally adopt the same safety-first approach. This mirrors the instinctual human reaction in split-second, high-pressure situations where the primary aim is self-preservation.
