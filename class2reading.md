# Text Editor 
## What is a Text Editor
It is a software that you download or access online to write and manage text that you write to build web sites. Some recommended features to have on your text editor
1. Code completion: This will allow you to start typing and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.
2. syntax highlighting: Is a feature that takes the text you type and makes it more noticeable by coloring the text, making attributes a different color than elements, and elements a different color than copy. This will make it easier to read and to find errors.
3. A variaty of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
