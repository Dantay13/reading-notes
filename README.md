## About Me

Hello all. Just a brief message introducing myself. My name is Danner Taylor, my pronouns are he, him, and I am located in the Cayman Islands, a Caribbean island south-west of Cuba, North-west of Jamaican in the Eastern Standard Time zone (GMT -5). My background is in finance, and I am currently a banker. I donâ€™t have much experience in software development, but I am a co-founder of a tech start-up company hence why I need to expand my knowledge in this field. I will be doing my work from my MacBook Air, macOS Monterey ver. 12.3.1. I am excited to learn, build, and network with my classmates, teachers, and other developers.
