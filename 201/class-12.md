1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?
<br>HTML5 features the `<canvas>` element that allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript. The `<canvas>` element requires at least two attributes: width and height that specify the size of the canvas
2. What is the importance of the closing ``</canvas>` tag?
<br> Unlike the `<img>` element, The `<canvas>` element requires the closing tag </canvas>. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the `<canvas>` element.
3. Explain what the getContext() method does.
<br> The `<canvas>` element features the getContext() method that returns a render context object. The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface. The 2D rendering context allows you to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.
