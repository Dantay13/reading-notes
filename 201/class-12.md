# Class 12 Readings: Chart.js, Canvas

## [JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)

1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?
<br> This element allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?
<br> The closing tag is important because the content within the opening and closing tag will be fallback content that will be displayed only if the browser does not support the `canvas` element.

3. Explain what the `getContext()` method does.
<br> Initially, the canvas is blank. To draw something, you need to access the rendering context and use it to draw on the canvas. The `<canvas>` element features the `getContext()` method that returns a render context object. The `getContext()` takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface. The 2D rendering context allows you to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.
