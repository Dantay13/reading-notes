## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

1. Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

2. Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

- Syntax error: creating a function with no call. This prevented the function from executing.
- Logic error: Trying to create an array of strings, but instead created parameters.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

This topic helped me to know the different types of errors that can be presented which allows me to better understand how to find the errors. This will help with my long term goal of becoming a more proficient and faster coder considering that I may spend less time debugging and trying to find what may be the issue.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

## Define what a breakpoint is

A breakpoint is where your line of codes will stop executing.

## What is the call stack?

The call stack is A section that shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to be more effieicient in debugging as it takes up a long time and hindir me from prpgressing in my development. I believe that fully understanding how to use the debugger tool will help me with this issue.
