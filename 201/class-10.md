## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

1. Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

2. Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to be more effieicient in debugging as it takes up a long time and hindir me from prpgressing in my development. I believe that fully understanding how to use the debugger tool will help me with this issue.
