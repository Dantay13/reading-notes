# Class 10 Readings: Debugging

## [What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
<br> - Syntax Error: These are spelling errors in the code that will cause it not to run and will ususlly provide an error message. This type of error is usually esier to fix compared to logic errors if you are able to dicipher the error message.
<br> - Logic Error: In this error the syntax may be correct but it is not for what you intended the code to do. So, the code may still run but provide incorrect results. This error is a bit more difficult to fix due that it may not display an error message.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
<br> - Syntax Error 1: In about me lab I was
<br> - Syntax Error 2:
<br> - Logic Error 1: In my "About me" lab I a prompt function where page visitors will input a number 
<br> - Logic Error 2:

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
<br> This topic will continue to influence me because it has equipped me with the knowledge and tools to be able to quickly find out what type of error I codes are experiencing and how to fix them.

## [The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
<br> Breakpoints are very useful when debugging JavaScript â€” you basically set a point in your code where you would like execution of the code to pause. At this point you can do useful things like studying the value of different variables at that point, allowing you to work out why a problem is occurring.

3. What is the call stack?
<br> It is a section that shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
