# Class 8 Readings: CSS Layout

## [Learn CSS - Flexbox](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
<br> It means that you cannot control the axis, row and a column of an item at the same time.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
<br> - The Main Axis: This is set by the property `flex-direction`. Meaning if it is in a row the main axis is along the row, if it is column the main axis is along the column.
<br> - The Cross Axis: This runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column, and vice versa.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
<br> When using properties like `ros-reverse` and `column-reverse` it can afffect your website accessibility as the logical and the visual order or the content may be off. This way make scree readers read content in a different order than how it is visually displayed.

"Flex-Flow Shorthand"

What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

1. Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
2. Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
3. Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
