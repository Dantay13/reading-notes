## CSS Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. I
The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.
You can do two things on the cross axis. You can move the items individually or as a group so they align against each other and the flex container. Also, if you have wrapped flex lines, you can treat those lines as a group in order to control how space is assigned to those lines.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
4. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
Float is a limited tool. Some limititations are:

- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
- Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

5. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
