# Class 2 Reading

This reading is to better understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS.
<br>This section is important because I will learn more about the sematics elements in HTML, how many level of headings are there and the uses for some elements.
<br> I will also learn about the ways to apply CSS to my HTML, and why to avoid using inline styles.
<br> In regards to JS i will learn what data type is a sequence of a text enclosed in a single quoate marks, some types of JavaScript operators and how I can solve real world problems with a function.

## Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Sematics elements are important because it help the browser to display blocks of texts into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis or importance to words, create lists, and so much more.

## How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

They are six heading elements and the main starts from `<h1>` and cotinue down into sub headings.

- `<h1>`
- `<h2>`
- `<h3>`
- `<h4>`
- `<h5>`
- `<h6>`

## What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?

These elements allow you to implement powers in mathematical equations, add values in formulae and add meaning to dates.
<br> In example: X`<sup>`2`</sup>`. This would be X to the power of 2.

## When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

This is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym, and provide a full expansion of the term (included inside a title attribute.)

## What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

1. External stylesheet
2. Internal Stylesheet
3. Inline Styles

## Why should we avoid using inline styles?

It is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.

## Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

The selector is representing the second level heading.
<br> The CSS is declaring the color component and the padding component.
<br> black, and 5px are considered attributes.


## What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

String

## List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

- `===` means "strictly equal"
- `=` means "assignment"
- `!` means "not"
- `!==` means "does-not-equal"

## Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

I told my frined if they come with me to the mall I will give them $50.00 if not i will not give them anything.

Code example: 
<br> let comeWith = false;
let friendGets;

if (comeWithToMall === true) {
        friendGets = 50;
} else {
    friendGets = 0;
}

## An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

- blank 1 = statement
- blank 2 = true

## What is the use of an else if?

This allow us to add more than just two choices or outcome to an `if...else` statememnt.

## What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

- `&&` — "AND"; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
- `||` — 'OR"; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to fully grasp what the different conditional statements results to.
