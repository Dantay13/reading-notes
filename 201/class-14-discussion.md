<br> a). Allowing members to share their opinions
<br> b). Community bond
<br> c). Empathy

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
<br> At my full time job we are a team of seven. In the past we used to be a team of 8, but the previous head of the department is no longer with the team. She was a very strict person and did not like when staffs made mistake. She also spoke to staff in a heavry and rough tone whenever staffs make mistake, or are cluesless about a task. This environments was not healthy as it made staffs nervous and afraid of making mistakes which eventually prevent staffs from wanting to explore in other areas and learn new things. Now that she is no longer with the team, the staffs appear to be happier and more willing to leanr new tasks.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
<br> Teams with high degree of phychological safety allow staffs to express themselves freely and become more efficient which ultimately makes company work culture helthier and the company output better. It also foster the growth of talented staffs and teams, because not only does it make their current staffs better but it also attracts other talents to want to be part of the company.
