# Class 1 Reading

This topic matter as is will give me an introduction of how the web works, some basics about the back-end of things and what is HTML.

## Getting Started

### How HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Sends Data Between Computers

### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser

HTML, css, and JavaScript are parced in order from top to bottom. The html file is the first to parses, then the browser recognize any `<link>` element references to external CSS stylesheets and then any `<script>` element referenses to sceript.

The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.

### How can you find images to add to a Website?

When you can find images in Google Images. When you find the image that you want, click it to get the enlarged view of it.
<br> Then save the image or copy the image's web address from your browser's address bar.
<br> Note that most images on the web, including in Google Images, are copyrighted. To reduce your likelihood of violating copyright, you can use Google's license filter. Click on the Tools button, then on the resulting Usage rights option that appears below. You should choose the option Creative Commons licenses.

### How do you create a 'String' vs a 'Number' in JavaScript?

string This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks. let myVariable = 'Bob';

This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them. let myVariable = 10;

### What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
<br> A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. 
<br> You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions. 
<br>Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.

## Introduction to HTML

### What is an HTML attribute?

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.

### Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element

An HTML element anatomy includes an opening tag, the content and the closing tag. 

### What is the Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` element tags?

`<article>`element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

`<section>` lement represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

### What Elements does a “typical” website include?

The elements in a typical website includes

- `<header>`
- `<nav>`
- `body`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`

### How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

### How is the `<meta>` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

### Thing I want to know more about

I will like to know more about the back-end of development. Know more about the functions of the server, how how the machines communicate and the different terminologies and meanings.
