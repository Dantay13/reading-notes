## JavaScript Object Basics

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

An object is like a bucket in which you would write a few instructions on a piece of paper and then placed inside of the bucket (Object).

### What are some advantages to creating object literals?

### How do objects differ from arrays?

<!-- Object is like a shell to house different variables, and a array is a list of different things. expand on -->

### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation

### Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?

## Introduction to the DOM

### What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

### Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript

The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.The document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document. They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.
