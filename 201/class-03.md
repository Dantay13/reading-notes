# Class 3 Reading Notes: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## [Learn HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

1. When should you use an `unordered list` in your HTML document?
<br> You use an unordered list when you want to render a list of items as bullet points.

2. How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?
<br> The bullet style would be changed in a CSS file.

3. When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unorder list` in your HTML document?
<br> You should use an ordered list is arranged by a order or some preceding marker. In order list you can make the list be in numerical values or letters.

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?
<br> You can change the number by using the `type` attribute in the ordered list tag or using the `start` attribute which will change the number at which the list will start from.

## [Learn CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)

- [The Box Model.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

1. Describe the CSS properties of `margin` and `padding` as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the `box model`.

## [Learn JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

- [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays)
- [Operators and Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)
- [Conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)
- [Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code)

1. What `data types` can you store inside of an `Array`?
<br> Strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays.

2. Is the `people` array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

- Assignment. Shorthand: `x = f()` Meaning: `x = f()`
- Addition assignment Shorthand: `x += f()` Meaning: `x = x + f()`
- Subtraction assignment Shorthand: `x -= f()` Meaning: `x = x - f()`
- Multiplication assignment Shorthand: `x *= f()` Meaning: `x = x * f()`
- Division assignment Shorthand: x /= f() Meaning: `x = x / f()`

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last `expression` and explain what the result would be and why.
<br> The result is `'10dog'`because `c` was assigned `false` therefore it did not become part of the equation and only the integer and string sum appears.

5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
<br> After an exam a teacher is grading works, so the teacher created a conditional if and else statement saying that if the answer is x mark as correct, else mark incorrect if it is any other answer.

6. Give an example of when a `Loop` is useful in JavaScript.
<br>  A loop is usedful when you have an array of things and you want a function that you constructed to apply to all the items in the array subsequently.
