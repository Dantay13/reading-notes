## How to do Headings

When creating headings in markdown it is initiated with a hash (number) sign (#) followed by the word of phrase. The number of hash signs used will determined the headings level. View below for a few examples.

1. # Heading level 1
2. ## Heading level 2
3. ### Heading level 3 

Please note that there must be a space inbetween the hash sign and the word/phrase.

## Paragraphs 

It is very simple to write a paragraph in markdown. Be sure to have a blank space between your heading and another body of text. Prevent indenting the paragraph with spaces or tabs.

## Line Breaks

When trying to include a line break in markdown you can use a "trailing whitespace" which is two or more spaces. But due to the difficulty of seeing the "trailing whitespace" in an editor, it can cause confusion. 
<br> Therefore a `<br>` HTML tag can be more useful if your markdown supports HTML.

Notes: When denoting a word or phrase as a code enclose it in backticks ( as used above.

## Using Emphasis

When trying to **bold** a word in markdown, add two asterisk or two underscore before and after the word or phrase. 
<br> When trying to _italize_ word in markdown use one asterisk or one underscore before and after the word or phrase.
<br> If your intension is to make a word bold and italized use three asterisk or three underscore before and after the ___word or phrase___.
